#+TITLE: Emacs doxy-graph minor mode 

=doxy-graph-mode= links source code to doxygen call graphs.

It allows to interactively see the call graph or the inverted call
graph of a given function or method from source code.

* Requirements

- emacs 26.3 (or newer).
- doxygen 1.8.13 (or newer).

* Basic Setup

After getting doxy-graph-mode.el you can add some of this lines to your =.emacs= file
if you want that doxy-graph-mode auto-loads when c-mode, c++-mode or python-mode are enabled.

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
(require 'doxy-graph-mode)

(add-hook 'c-mode-hook 'doxy-graph-mode)
(add-hook 'c++-mode-hook 'doxy-graph-mode)
(add-hook 'python-mode-hook 'doxy-graph-mode)
#+END_SRC

You can add a hook for another one of the languages supported by doxygen.

* Usage

Firts of all you have to generate doxygen latex documentation
including call graphs. To carry out this you can generate a =Doxyfile=
config file with the command =doxygen -g= in your source code path.

It is necessary to change the following settings inside =Doxyfile=.

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
CALL_GRAPH             = YES

CALLER_GRAPH           = YES
#+END_SRC

An example of =Doxyfile= is given in this repository.

You can invoque ~doxy-graph-mode~ commad =M x doxy-graph-mode=.

When mini mode is active you can position the cursor over function
name and visualize call graph and inverted call graph.

Default keybindings are:

- =<C-f1>= Opens direct call graph.
- =<C-f2>= Opens inverted call graph.

[[./img/inverted-call-graph.png]]

First time is called =doxy-graph-open-call-graph= or
=doxy-graph-open-inverted-call-graph= it is asked for select doxygen
latex folder. You can choose doxygen latex folder using the directory
chooser.

Calling the interactive function =doxy-graph-set-latex-path= you can
change the folder where doxygen latex docs are placed.

If you wish you can change default keybindings using
=doxy-graph-mode-map=. The following example binds =C c c= and =C c i=
like default shortcuts.

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
(define-key doxy-graph-mode-map (kbd "C-c c") 'doxy-graph-open-call-graph)
(define-key doxy-graph-mode-map (kbd "C-c i") 'doxy-graph-open-inverted-call-graph)
#+END_SRC
